## Introduction

In the fast-evolving world of design and development, bridging the gap between creative design and code implementation is essential. The Figma MCP Server is engineered to streamline this process by acting as a middleware that translates Figma design data into a structured context for AI coding assistants. This integration not only enhances productivity but also reduces the manual overhead typically involved in converting designs to code.

## What is Figma MCP?

Figma MCP is a server implementation of the Model Context Protocol. Its primary function is to deliver a standardized context—which encompasses layout, components, and styling—to various LLMs. Through this protocol, designers and developers can leverage AI to automate tasks, generate reusable user interface components, and maintain a high degree of consistency throughout the workflow. The server is an enabling factor that helps maximize the potential of AI integration in modern design processes.

## How Does Figma MCP Work?

At its core, the Figma MCP Server performs the following functions:

- **Protocol Implementation:** It utilizes the Model Context Protocol as a universal adapter that allows different AI systems to interact with Figma data effortlessly.
- **Figma API Integration:** The server connects to Figma’s API using an access token. This connection allows it to fetch design files, components, and style definitions in a read-only mode.
- **Data Simplification:** It processes and simplifies complex design data so that AI tools can extract the essential layout and styling information without being overwhelmed by unnecessary details.
- **Standardized Communication:** Through defined endpoints—such as those for server-sent events (SSE)—the server provides a reliable mechanism for AI assistants to receive up-to-date design information.

This structured approach ensures that AI models obtain accurate, concise, and relevant design context for generating high-fidelity code.

## Setup and Usage

Getting started with the Figma MCP Server involves several clearly defined steps:

### Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure that you have the following:

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher)
- **npm** (version 7.0 or higher) or **pnpm** (version 8.0 or higher)
- A **Figma Account** (Professional or Enterprise plan is recommended)
- A **Figma API Access Token** with read permissions

### Obtaining a Figma API Access Token

1. **Register for a Figma Account:**  
   Visit [Figma's official website](https://www.figma.com) and sign up if you do not already have an account.
2. **Download the Figma Desktop App:**  
   Select the version compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and install it.
3. **Log in and Access Profile Settings:**  
   Launch the Figma app, sign in using your credentials, and click your profile icon in the sidebar.
4. **Navigate to Security Settings:**  
   In the dropdown menu, go to the Settings page and then click on the Security tab.
5. **Generate a Personal Access Token:**  
   Scroll to the Personal Access Tokens section and click on “Generate New Token”. Name the token (e.g., `Figma_MCP`), generate it, and immediately copy it (Figma shows it only once). Save it securely using a password manager or an encrypted file.
6. **Secure Your Token Using Environment Variables:**  
   For example, in your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   export FIGMA_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   ```

### Installing the Figma MCP Server

You can quickly install the server using NPM without manual repository installation:

```bash
npx figma-developer-mcp --figma-api-key=<your-figma-api-key>
```

Alternatively, to install from the local source:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP.git
   cd Figma-Context-MCP
   ```
2. Install dependencies using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace placeholder values with your Figma API token.
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

### Configuring the Server

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Set the `FIGMA_API_TOKEN` and optionally the `PORT` (default is 3333) in the `.env` file.
- **Command-Line Arguments:**  
  Options such as `--figma-api-key` and `--port` can be used directly via the command line; these take precedence over the environment variables.

### Integrating with AI Tools

Once the server is up and running, integrate it with AI tools (e.g., Cursor IDE) as follows:

1. **Ensure the Server is Running:**  
   Verify that it is active on the correct port by running the installation command.
2. **Add the MCP Server to Your AI Tool:**  
   For Cursor:
   - Open the application and navigate to the Settings > MCP section.
   - Click “Add New MCP Server” and enter a name (e.g., “Figma MCP”).
   - Choose the SSE (Server-Sent Events) option and enter the server URL (typically `http://localhost:3333`).
3. **Verify the Connection:**  
   A green status indicator will confirm successful integration. A red indicator signals the need for troubleshooting.
4. **Work with Figma Designs:**  
   In Figma, select your desired design, group components if necessary, and copy the design link using the “Copy Link to Selection” option. In Cursor Composer (with Agent Mode enabled), paste the link to prompt AI tasks such as generating React code, creating reusable UI components, or optimizing layouts.

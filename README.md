# Figma Design Clone with MCP Server & Cursor AI

This project is a React application that clones a Figma design using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, integrated with Cursor AI. The UI is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and is developed to be 100% pixel-perfect based on the Figma design.

## Project Overview

The project clones a Figma design into a fully functional dashboard interface. The MCP server handles the communication between Figma and the code generator, while Cursor AI assists in refining and generating a pixel-perfect UI. Key features include:

- **100% Pixel-Perfect Replica:** The cloned UI matches the Figma design in layout, typography, colors, and spacing.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Components are structured and organized following best practices.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is fully responsive for various screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (or yarn)
- A Figma account and design file URL
- A running MCP server configured for Figma integration
- Cursor AI for continuous code improvements

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project/demo-ai-mcp/demo-bank-dash
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add necessary configuration details, for example:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_FIGMA_API_KEY=your_figma_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_MCP_SERVER_URL=http://your-mcp-server-url
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will run locally (typically at `http://localhost:5173`).

2. **Integrate with MCP Server & Cursor AI:**

   - Ensure your MCP server is running and accessible.
   - Use Cursor AI to analyze the Figma design and generate code for the dashboard UI.
   - The generated code will be integrated into your React app to display a 100% pixel-perfect Figma clone.

3. **Modifying the UI:**

   - The code structure follows a modular component architecture.
   - Review individual components under the `/src/components` directory.
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling adjustments.

## Deployment

You can deploy your static website using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. For example, to deploy on Vercel:

1. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import the Repository in Vercel:**

   - Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and create a new project.
   - Set the **Build Command** to `npm run build` and **Output Directory** to `dist`.

3. **Deploy:**

   Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy your project on each push.
